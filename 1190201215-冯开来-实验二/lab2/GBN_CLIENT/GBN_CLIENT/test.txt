The Chinese mainland will punish the stubborn secessionists on a blacklist who engage in seeking "Taiwan independence" in accordance with the law, Zhu Fenglian, a spokeswoman of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, said in a statement on Friday.

Su Tseng-chang, head of Taiwan's executive body; Yu Shyi-kun, who is in charge of the local "legislature" in Taiwan; and Joseph Wu Jau-shieh, the island's leader of external affairs, are included on the list, according to the statement.

Zhu said that for some time a very small number of stubborn "Taiwan independence" secessionists have been inciting cross-Straits confrontation, maliciously attacking and slandering the mainland and colluding with foreign forces to split the country.
